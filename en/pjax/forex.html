                                <p>A Forex trader has one objective in mind when trading: to exchange one currency for another in order to make a profit.</p>
                                <p>But if you’re new to Forex or financial trading of any kind, there’s still a long way to go before you even purchase your first contract. This is why we’ve come up with a basic, step-by-step tutorial to help you bridge that gap and make your first trade.</p>
                                <p>Step 1: Learn to read currency pairs<br>
                                Step 2: Understand when to buy (go long) and when to sell (go short)<br>
                                Step 3: Buy your first currency pair

                                <h2>Step 1: Learn to read currency pairs</h2>
                                <p>Can’t make heads or tails of currency pairs? Here’s a simple way of looking at it:</p>
                                <div class="fill-bg-color lg-padding">
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <div class="col-sm center-text"><span class="secondary-color">EUR</span> / USD</div>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="row">
                                        <div class="col-sm"><p class="txt-right secondary-color">
                                            <strong>Base currency</strong><br>Also known as transaction currency</strong>
                                        </p></div>
                                        <div class="col-sm"><p>
                                            <strong>Quote currency</strong><br>Also known as counter currency</strong>
                                        </p></div>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <p>Tips:</p>
                                <ul class="bullet">
                                    <li>The base currency is always equal to <strong>one unit</strong>.</li>
                                    <li>The price of the currency pair indicates how much of the quote currency is required to buy the base currency. This is more commonly known as the exchange rate.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>For example, if you see EUR/USD = 1.0453 and you decide to buy, this means that you’ll <strong>receive EUR 1</strong> for every USD 1.0453 sold.</p>
                                <p>If you were to sell the base currency, you’ll receive USD 1.0453 for every EUR 1 sold.</p>
                                <h2>Step 2: Understand when to buy (go long) and when to sell (go short)</h2>
                                <p>You want to buy a certain currency pair if you think the base currency will go up. The reverse holds true: you want to sell that currency pair if you think the base currency will go down.</p>
                                <p>You’ve probably seen the terms ‘going long’ and ‘going short’ being used by a lot of Forex brokers and traders. Let’s compare the differences between the two terms:</p>

                                                <li>You’re expecting the base currency to rise in value so you can sell it back for a profit.</li>

                                                <li>You’re expecting the base currency to fall in value so you can buy it back at a lower price (and make a profit).</li>

                                <p>Here’s an example: how does going long or going short apply to the GBP/USD?</p>
                                <p>After your analysis, you’ve come to the conclusion that the British economy will outperform its U.S. counterpart. Thus, you decide to go long and buy into the GBP/USD, expecting the GBP to rise in value.</p>
                                <p>If you decided that the British economy will underperform instead, then you will go short on the GBP/USD.</p>
                                <h2>Step 3: Buy your first currency pair</h2>
                                <p>After you’ve decided which position you want to take – whether long or short – you are well on your way to buying your first currency pair.</p>
                                <p>Here’s an example of a GBP/USD currency pair and its bid-ask price.</p>

                                <p>To go long, you’ll click on ‘Buy’ to purchase GBP 1 for USD 1.22781.</p>
                                <p>To go short, you’ll click on ‘Sell’ to sell GBP 1 and receive USD 1.22771 in return.</p>

                                <h2>Margin policy</h2>
                                <p>We explain our margin policy to give you a better understanding of how Forex trading works.</p>
                                <h2>What is margin?</h2>
                                <p>Margin allows you to trade on leverage, giving you the same level of market exposure using much less capital.</p>
                                <p>For example, if you wanted to purchase 100 units of a particular asset trading at USD 50 per unit through a traditional broker, it would cost you USD 5,000 for this transaction.</p>
                                <p>With CFD (which is a leveraged product), you can purchase 100 units of the same asset at a fraction of the cost.</p>

                                <p>The margin for our CFDs is calculated as follows:</p>
                                <div class="fill-bg-color lg-padding center-text">
                                    <p>Volume (trade size) x price x margin rate = Margin</p>
                                    <p>For e.g. If you buy 1 Volume of an underlying asset at a price of EUR 20,000 and a margin rate of 0.01, the margin required to purchase that one lot will be calculated as follows:</p>
                                    <p>1 x 20,000 / 100 = EUR 200</p>
                                </div>
                                <p>The margin for our Forex trades is calculated as follows:</p>
                                <div class="fill-bg-color lg-padding center-text">
                                    <p>Volume (lots) x lot size / leverage = Margin</p>
                                    <p>For e.g. If you buy one lot of the EUR/USD symbol with a contract size of 100,000 and leverage of 100:1, the margin required to purchase that one lot will be calculated as follows:</p>
                                    <p>1 x 100,000 / 100 = EUR 1,000</p>
                                </div>
                                <h2>What’s a margin call and how do we apply it?</h2>
                                <p>When your account equity is unable to cover the margin requirement, your account will be placed under margin call. This state does not affect your ability to open new positions</p>
                                <h2>What’s a stop out level and how do we apply it?</h2>
                                <p>If your account is placed under margin call for an extended period of time, it will reach the stop out level where it’s unable to sustain an open position. This will lead to your pending orders being deleted, and open positions being forcibly closed (also known as forced liquidation).</p>
                                <p>Our forced liquidation level is 50% for Volatility Indices, and 100% for Forex. Once your account hits the forced liquidation level, your orders and positions are forcibly closed in the following order:</p>
                                <ul class="bullet">
                                    <li>We analyse your pending orders.</li>
                                    <li>We delete an order with the largest margin reserved.</li>
                                    <li>If your margin level is still under the stop out level, your next order will be deleted. However, orders without margin requirements will not be deleted.</li>
                                    <li>If your margin level is still under the stop out level, we will close an open position with the largest loss.</li>
                                    <li>We will continue to close open positions until your margin level becomes higher than the stop out level.</li>
                                </ul>

                                        <p><strong>1. Account currency</strong> is the currency of the funds accepted in your trading account.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. Leverage</strong> is the ability to control a large amount of money using a minimal capital from yourself. Where does the rest of the money come from? Your trusted broker provides the rest.</p>
                                        <p>Let’s say you fork out a capital of USD 50 and we’re offering a leverage of 1:1,000. How much money, or margin, is available to you when you start trading?</p>
                                        <p class="center-text fill-bg-color lg-padding">USD 50 x 1,000 = <strong>USD 50,000 (is the margin available)</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>3. Order execution</strong> typically comes in two varieties: market execution and instant execution. With market execution, you place an order at the broker’s price. You agree on the price in advance. There are no requotes with market execution.</p>
                                        <p>What about instant execution? In this case, your order is place at the price that’s available at that time. Requotes are possible if the price fluctuates a great deal before the order execution is complete.</p>
                                        <p><strong>4. Spread</strong> is the difference between the buy price and sell price. When you enter into a trade, you are buying an asset that you will be selling at a later time or date for a profit or loss. The difference in price is called a spread. A fixed spread means that the spread will remain as it is no matter the market condition. A variable spread means that the spread may increase depending on market conditions, as it is subject to market volatility caused by news events.</p>
                                        <p><strong>5. Commission</strong> refers to the commission fees that we charge for each trade you place with us. Champion FX currently charges no commission for all accounts.</p>
                                        <p><strong>6. Margin call</strong> refers to the state where the remaining funds in your account is unable to cover the leverage or margin requirement. You can deposit additional funds to prevent a margin call escalating to a stop out level.</p>
                                        <p><strong>7. Stop out level</strong> is the level where your margin ratio has become unsustainable, and we issue a forced closure of pending orders, and any open positions. A stop out level usually results from a high negative balance in your trading account.</p>
                                        <p><strong>8. Hedged margin</strong> refers to the funds required to open and maintain a position on the same asset, but in opposite directions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>9. A swap-free option</strong> is an account that incurs no interest or swap charges on overnight positions. This option is ideal for those with certain religious restrictions when it comes to paying interest.</p>
