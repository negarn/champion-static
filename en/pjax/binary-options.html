                                <h2>What is binary options trading?</h2>
                                <p>A binary option is a type of option with a fixed payout. The payout is determined at the start before you purchase the trade. If your prediction is correct, you receive the fixed (and stated) payout. If not, you will lose your initial stake and nothing more. It is called a 'binary' option because there can only be two outcomes: you either win or lose.</p>
                                <p>Whatever market you trade in, always remember that you're not purchasing the asset itself, but a contract (or "option") that determines how the asset performs over a period of time. This limits your risk and makes it easy for anyone to start trading.</p>

                                <div class="fx-define-position fx-xlg"></div>
                                <p>First, you need to set the parameters of your trade. Here's what you need to consider.</p>
                                <ul class="bullet">
                                    <li>
                                        Underlying market
                                        <p>Choose the asset you wish to trade, such as gold, oil, stocks, or currency pairs. The value of a binary option is derived from the price of the underlying asset. One advantage of trading binary options is that you are not buying or selling the actual asset, only a contract that determines how that asset performs.</p>
                                        <p>Choose from five types of markets and their respective assets:</p>
                                        <ul class="bullet">
                                            <li>Currencies – All major Forex pairs</li>
                                            <li>Stock indices – All major worldwide stock indices sourced from the over-the-counter market</li>
                                            <li>Commodities – Major commodities such as gold and oil</li>
                                            <li>OTC stocks – Blue-chip stock contracts sourced from the over-the-counter market</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Trade type
                                        <p>There are four trade types for you to choose from:</p>
                                        <ul class="bullet">
                                            <li>Rise/Fall – Predict if the market will rise or fall from its current level</li>
                                            <li>Higher/Lower – Predict if the market will end higher or lower than a target price</li>
                                            <li>Touch/No Touch – Predict if the market will touch or not touch a target price</li>
                                            <li>In/Out – Predict if the market will stay between or outside two target prices</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Duration
                                        <p>Set the length of your trade, from 10 seconds to 365 days. You don’t even need to wait until expiry. Sell back any long-term trades that you purchased at any time to profit from favourable market conditions.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Barrier(s)
                                        <p>Set barrier(s) to define your position and trigger the payout you will receive.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Trade type
                                        <p>Each trade comes with a pre-determined payout that you will see after adjusting each parameter. You’ll win the payout if your prediction is correct.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Step 2: Get your price</h4>
                                <p>Our prices are benchmarked against the interbank options market, so you always get the best prices. You’ll always receive fair and transparent pricing, whatever your position.</p>
                                <h4>Step 3: Make your trade</h4>
                                <p>When you are satisfied with the price that you receive, execute your trade immediately. With our unique platform, there’s no risk of ‘slippage’ or gapping markets. And most importantly, there are no hidden fees. You can also sell back any long-term trades at any time to profit from favourable market conditions.</p>
