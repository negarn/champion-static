                            <p>A Contract for Difference (CFD) is a financial derivative that allows you to potentially profit by speculating on the rise or fall of an underlying asset, without actually owning that asset.</p>

                                <p>However, if the asset price falls by 10 points, that represents a USD 10 loss for you.</p>

                    <h2>What are indices?</h2>
                    <p>An index (plural: indices) measures the performance of a selected group of assets. It is often used as a tool by investors to gauge the overall performance of a specific market.</p>
                    <p>The most popular category of indices is stock market indices. For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index shows how 30 public companies based in the United States perform in the stock market.</p>
                    <p>Since an index serves as an indicator of multiple assets, you cannot trade an index like how you would buy and sell stocks. Instead, you need to use a financial derivative product such as a Contract for Difference (CFD) to speculate and profit on the price movement of an index.</p>
